This project was the main and last project of my 'Machine-Learning' course (Course Project).
This project is about finding the best possible model for each of the three tasks of Regression, Classification, and Clustering on their corresponding real world datasets.
This folder contains the code, project report, and the project description file.
Datasets files are not contained in the repository!
